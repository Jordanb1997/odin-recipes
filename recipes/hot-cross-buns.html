                Combine flour, yeast, sugar, mixed spice, salt and currants in a large bowl.
                Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat.
                Add milk. Heat for 1 minute, or until lukewarm.
                Add warm milk mixture and eggs to currant mixture.
                Use a flat-bladed knife to mix until dough almost comes together.
                Use clean hands to finish mixing to form a soft dough.
            </li>
            <li>
                Turn dough out onto a floured surface.
                Knead for 10 minutes, or until dough is smooth.
                Place into a lightly oiled bowl. Cover with plastic wrap.
                Set aside in a warm, draught-free place for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, or until dough doubles in size.  
            </li>
            <li>
                Line a large baking tray with non-stick baking paper.
                Punch dough down to its original size.
                Knead for 30 seconds on a lightly floured surface until smooth.
                Divide into 12 even portions. Shape each portion into a ball.
                Place balls onto lined tray, about 1cm apart.
                Cover with plastic wrap. Set aside in a warm, draught-free place for 30 minutes, or until buns double in size.
                Preheat oven to 190°C or 170˚C fan-force.

                Make flour paste: Mix flour and water together in a small bowl until smooth, adding a little more water if paste is too thick.
                Spoon into a small snap-lock bag.
                Snip off 1 corner of bag.
                Pipe flour paste over tops of buns to form crosses.
                Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until buns are cooked through.

                Make glaze: Place water and sugar into a small saucepan over low heat.
                Stir until sugar dissolves.
                Bring to the boil.
                Boil for 3-4 minutes.
                Brush warm glaze over warm hot cross buns.
                Serve warm or at room temperature with a butter as desired.

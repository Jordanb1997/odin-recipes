        <h1>step 1</h1>
        <p>
            Combine flour, yeast, sugar, mixed spice, salt and currants in a large bowl.
            Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat.
            Add milk. Heat for 1 minute, or until lukewarm.
            Add warm milk mixture and eggs to currant mixture.
            Use a flat-bladed knife to mix until dough almost comes together.
            Use clean hands to finish mixing to form a soft dough.
        </p>
        <h1>step 2</h1>
        <p>
            Turn dough out onto a floured surface.
            Knead for 10 minutes, or until dough is smooth.
            Place into a lightly oiled bowl. Cover with plastic wrap.
            Set aside in a warm, draught-free place for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, or until dough doubles in size.  
        </p>
        <h1>step 3</h1>
        <p>
            Line a large baking tray with non-stick baking paper.
            Punch dough down to its original size.
            Knead for 30 seconds on a lightly floured surface until smooth.
            Divide into 12 even portions. Shape each portion into a ball.
            Place balls onto lined tray, about 1cm apart.
            Cover with plastic wrap. Set aside in a warm, draught-free place for 30 minutes, or until buns double in size.
            Preheat oven to 190°C or 170˚C fan-force.
        </p>
        <h1>step 4</h1>
        <p>
            Make flour paste: Mix flour and water together in a small bowl until smooth, adding a little more water if paste is too thick.
            Spoon into a small snap-lock bag.
            Snip off 1 corner of bag.
            Pipe flour paste over tops of buns to form crosses.
            Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until buns are cooked through.
        </p>
        <h1>step 5</h1>

            Make glaze: Place water and sugar into a small saucepan over low heat.
            Stir until sugar dissolves.
            Bring to the boil.
            Boil for 3-4 minutes.
            Brush warm glaze over warm hot cross buns.
            Serve warm or at room temperature with a butter as desired.
